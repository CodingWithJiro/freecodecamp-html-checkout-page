![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This website displays a simple checkout page for PlayStation5. Created as part of the **[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)** HTML5 free course.

## Overview

This project is a beginner-level exercise that uses HTML5 and very minimal CSS3 to mimic a checkout page in an ecommerce website. It demonstrates proper use of table-related elements like `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` form elements like `<input>`, `<label>`, and `<fieldset>`.

## Features

- Tabular data structuring (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`)
- Proper use of HTML `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements
- Correct headings hierarchy `<h1>`, `<h2>`, ...
- Form structuring which submits to **[httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/post)**
